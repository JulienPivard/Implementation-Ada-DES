Dans sa demeure de R'lyeh le défunt Cthulhu rêve et attend
Du fond de son tombeau à R'lyeh, Cthulhu rêve et attend

N'est pas mort ce qui à jamais dort
Et au fil des âges peut mourir même la mort

  That is not dead which can eternal lie;
  And with strange aeons even death may die.

Ils venaient des étoiles,
et Leurs idoles Les avaient accompagnés dans Leur chute


« Tout ce que je dis c'est que je pense qu'il est franchement improbable
qu'il y ait quoi que ce soit qui ressemble à une volonté cosmique centrale,
à un monde spirituel ou à un être éternel.
Il s'agit là des idées les plus absurdes et les plus injustifiées que
l'on puisse avoir à propos de l'univers et je ne suis pas assez pinailleur
pour prétendre que je ne les vois pas comme autre chose que de fieffées
idioties. Dans l'idée, je suis agnostique, mais comme je préfère me
ranger du côté des preuves tangibles, on doit me classer parmi les athées »

H.P. Lovecraft

When age fell upon the world, and wonder went out of the minds of men;
when grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly,
in whose shadow none might dream of the sun or of spring’s flowering
meads; when learning stripped earth of her mantle of beauty, and poets
sang no more save of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and
inward-looking eyes; when these things had come to pass, and childish
hopes had gone away forever, there was a man who travelled out of life
on a quest into the spaces whither the world’s dreams had fled. Of the
name and abode of this man but little is written, for they were of the
waking world only; yet it is said that both were obscure. It is enough
to know that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile twilight
reigned, and that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil, coming
home at evening to a room whose one window opened not on the fields
and groves but on a dim court where other windows stared in dull despair.
From that casement one might see only walls and windows, except sometimes
when one leaned far out and peered aloft at the small stars that passed.
And because mere walls and windows must soon drive to madness a man who
dreams and reads much, the dweller in that room used night after night
to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond
the waking world and the greyness of tall cities. After years he began to
call the slow-sailing stars by name, and to follow them in fancy when
they glided regretfully out of sight; till at length his vision opened to
many secret vistas whose existence no common eye suspects. And one night
a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream-haunted skies swelled down to
the lonely watcher’s window to merge with the close air of his room and
make him a part of their fabulous wonder. There came to that room wild
streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold; vortices of dust
and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from
beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that the eye
may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and
sea-nymphs of unrememberable deeps. Noiseless infinity eddied around the
dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned
stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men’s calendars
the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he
longed; the dreams that men have lost. And in the course of many cycles
they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore; a green shore
fragrant with lotus-blossoms and starred by red camalotes.
